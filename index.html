    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      MYCO Projects was born out of a long-standing, deeply personal relationship with space.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more than a decade, the studio’s founder designed homes quietly and informally for friends—refining apartments, rethinking rooms, and helping people articulate how they wanted to live rather than how they thought a space <em>should</em> look. What began as a passion project evolved organically into a practice, shaped by lived experience, trust, and an intuitive understanding of how interiors support daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
      The studio’s approach is rooted in restraint, warmth, and intention. Spaces are not conceived as visual statements, but as environments meant to be inhabited—calm, grounded, and quietly expressive. Materials are chosen for their depth and longevity; furniture is selected for presence rather than novelty; light is treated as something to be felt as much as seen. The result is interiors that feel resolved without ever feeling overdesigned.
    </p>

    <p>
      What distinguishes the studio is not a signature look, but a consistent point of view: that good design should feel effortless, personal, and enduring. The goal is never to impress, but to create spaces that clients return to at the end of the day and feel immediately at ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      MYCO Projects works across residential interiors, offering a thoughtful, collaborative process grounded in trust, clarity, and a belief that the most successful spaces are those that feel both intentional and deeply human.
